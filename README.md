# Overview

The program provides a basic interface for managing and tracking student names and grades, allowing the user to add students, add grades, calculate and display average grades, and save the data for future use.

I wrote this program as an opportunity to learn the C++ programming language. I wrote it to learn the syntax and different structures that this language offers.

# Development Environment

I used CLion as my integrated development environment (IDE) for C++ on Windows. It's designed to streamline the programming process, making it easier to write, test, debug, and maintain code.


The C++ language is an object-oriented language that is used for embedded and application development. It is based on the C language. C++ requires the use of a compiler and linker, which are operating systemâ€“ and processor-specific. C++ includes the Standard Template Library (STL), which provides support for data structures and threading.

# Future Work

- Extend the program to track student grades for multiple courses or subjects.
- Implement filtering options to display students who meet specific criteria
- Allow users to edit student names and grades.
